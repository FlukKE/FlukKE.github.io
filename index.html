          GUNDAM is an anime series publised by Bandai and created and broadcasted by<br>
          Sunrise Animation. The brief story was about the war between earth-human or <br>
          the Earth Federation and the sapcenoids who wanted to be independant from human<br>
          they also called themselves ZEON, but the war had been one-sided since ZEON had <br>
          created thier ultimate battle machines called "Moblie Suits" which took advantages<br>
          of thier high mobility and manuverbility and equiped with high firepower weapons<br>
          leaving the Moblie Armors and BattleShips unmatched. But the war had shifted once<br>
          more since the Earth Federation had revealed thier ultimate weapon that will end<br>
          the war once and for all.
